  [Introduction to Metadata by Murtha Baca]
  (https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/intrometadata/index.html)

- I have been impressed and curious about the term "meta" as it describes something
  indefinite. Finding this book has a title "Metadata" makes me want to learn more
  about it to get to a nice introduction about what "meta" really means. What I have
  known about metadata is to describe tremendous amount of information being collected
  from human's activities through social media networks. The introduction of this book
  explaining about they will discuss in each chapter really inspires me to connect metadata
  with real life experiences and activities that most of us are living in.
